# Use Project Virtual Environment

The agent must always activate the local project virtual environment located at `./.venv` before running any Python script or using `uv`.

*   **Activation Command (Linux/macOS):** `source .venv/bin/activate`
*   **Activation Command (Windows CMD):** `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
*   Ensure subsequent commands run within the activated shell session.
